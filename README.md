# path-wanderer
Red V3 cog that allows users to do things for Pathfinder 2e in Discord.

(Written for my friends to play Pathfinder together.)

## Usage
To get started, `import` character information from a Pathbuilder 2e JSON.

### Commands
These function very much like those of the Avrae Discord bot:
`check` - ability, skill, and lore skill checks 
`save` - saving throws
`update` - update character information after exporting the JSON again
`sheet` - show character sheet

### Character management
`character list` - see who's been imported
`character setactive` - set active character
`character remove` - remove a character from the list

## Notes
Special thanks to the Avrae team, from whom I got: 1. much of my formatting 2. a lot of inspiration 3. the freedom to run wild with its aliasing API, and to the Tsubaki team, from whom I learned almost everything I know about bot development.
