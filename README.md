# path-wanderer
Red V3 cog that allows users to do things for Pathfinder 2e in Discord.

(Written for my friends to play Pathfinder together.)

## Usage
To get started, `import` character information from a Pathbuilder 2e JSON. Many commands follow similarly to how commands for the Avrae bot work, such as `check`, `save`, and `sheet`. Implementation is limited, but hopefully minimally sufficient. Characters can be managed with `character` and its subcommands.

## Notes
Special thanks to the Avrae team, from whom I got: 1. much of my formatting 2. a lot of inspiration 3. the freedom to run wild with its aliasing API, and to the Tsubaki team, from whom I learned almost everything I know about bot development.
